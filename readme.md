mixedArray.json: This example defines fields as an array. Non-object fields are defined with just the field name. Object fields are defined as objects.

streamConfig.gql: The GraphQL example configuration.

gqlTypeExampleinJSON: The JSON representation which matches the gql proposal very closely. In this example, fields is an object, and each individual field is a property of that object. The ```fields``` object can either be a list of strings for the simple case or an object mapping field name to configuration.
